# malariaSEIR

A deterministic model of malaria infection, currently based off the Tanzanian population and infection parameters from the area. 

This project is part of the Public Health Certificate Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

This model will look at the impact of breath volatiles on Malaria infection, a collaboration with Tzvi Pollock in Audrey Odom John's lab and CHOP.
